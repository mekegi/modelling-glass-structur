= Sintaxis of MAPLE-file =
The output of the program generates two files. OUT.TXT and MAPLE.TXT. 
The first file information on the energy system as a whole at each step. In the second file with the coordinates of points in the Maple-Text.

In the first line, we connect the library * plots *, not all, but only functions _Interactive_ and _pointplot3d_ 
_pointplot3d_ - draws a point 3-D graph. 
_Interactive_ - Need to ensure that after drawing the graphics could have been using the mouse to rotate the graph from different angles for better visual perception. (Feature _restart_ need to clear the memory of the old variables. "Garbage collection") 

The functions _pointplot3d_ we send an array of dots. The array is defined using curly brackets, inside which are a comma-separated array 
each point is a set of three numbers * x, y, z * prisoners in curly brackets, eg `[1, -1,1]` 
The symbol `#` is used for comments. everything after that character is not processed interpreter Maple. (in our case, I use comments to display the distance from a point prior to the start coordinates and the charge for debugging) 

In order to see what will need to run Maple (for versions older than 9 should start Classic Worksheet Maple is not a standard Maple. Because standard glyukovat and szhiraet a lot of system resources) 

When you start Maple, text file MAPLE.TXT need to copy in the window and press Enter. And get some picture here
